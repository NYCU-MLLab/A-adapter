# Adversarial training with adapter in NLP/NLU

Adversarial training and adapter structure benefit pre-trained model transfer learning, especially in low-resource datasets. Here we upload different kinds of adversarial training algorithms w/o adapters for easily modify. A_adapter includes several adversarial algorithms with adapter pre-trained models. Adversarial Training for NLU includes the same but without the adapter.
