# Adversarial training with adapter in NLP/NLU

Adversarial training and adapter structure benefit pre-trained model transfer learning, especially in low-resource datasets. Here we upload different kinds of adversarial training algorithms w/o adapters for easily modify. A_adapter includes several adversarial algorithms with adapter pre-trained models. Adversarial Training for NLU includes the same but without the adapter.

## Instructions
This work is based on huggingface transformers and adapter-Hub.
Notice that w/o adapter does not share the same environment. It would be best if builts them separately.
